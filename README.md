## BusMall

I build a market analysis app that presents the user with three random products from a catalog of twenty. The user selects the product they would be most likely to purchase from the group of images and is then presented with a new set of three images to chose from. None of the images in the round will repeat any of the images in the previous round. After 25 choices have been made, the user is presented with a "View Results" button. When clicked, the button will be removed and the results of the survey will be displayed to the left, indicating the number of times each product was shown, how many times it was selected and the percentage of times the product was selected when it was presented as a choice. This information will also be mirrored in a bar graph at the bottom of the page. The number of voting rounds can also be adjusted by changing the value of the 'maxRounds' variable.

### Reflections and Comments

**Lab: 11**

- I was able to achieve the primary goals within our alotted lab time. However, I then proceeded to spend an additional 4 hours styling and tweaking and adding extra functionality to the project before I was satisfied for the night.

**Lab: 12**

- I was able to refactor my code to meet the new requirements more easily than I had thought I would. I believe this is partially due to the fact that my orignal architecture for my app.js was conceived of well enough and flexible enough that it required only minor adjustments to produce the desired results.
- I made use of the Chart.js library and documentation to incorporate the desired chart showing number of votes and times shown for each product. _(see link above)_
- I kept styling changes to a minimum today as I did not feel I needed to address it at this point.
