# Lab: 11

## BusMall

I build a market analysis app that presents the user with three random products from a catalog of twenty. The user selects the product they would be most likely to purchase from the group of images and is then presented with a new set of three images to chose from. After 25 choices have been made, the user is presented with a "View Results" button. When clicked, the button will be removed and the results of the survey will be displayed, indicating the number of times each product was shown, how many times it was selected and the percentage of times the product was selected when it was presented as a choice. The number of voting rounds can also be adjusted by changing the value of the 'maxRounds' variable.

### Reflections and Comments

- I was able to achieve the primary goals within our alotted lab time. However, I then proceeded to spend an additional 4 hours styling and tweaking and adding extra functionality to the project before I was satisfied for the night.
